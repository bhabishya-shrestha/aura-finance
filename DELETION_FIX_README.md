# üîß Account Deletion Fix

## Problem

Deleted accounts were reappearing after page refresh due to Firebase sync automatically restoring them from the cloud. The sync logic was treating deleted accounts as "missing" data that needed to be restored.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `mergeAndSyncData` function in `src/services/firebaseSync.js`. When an account was deleted locally but still existed in Firebase, the sync process would automatically restore it:

```javascript
if (!localItem && remoteItem) {
  // Remote item doesn't exist locally - add it
  mergedData.push(remoteItem);
  await this.addToLocal(remoteItem, dataType);
}
```

This logic didn't distinguish between:

- **Intentionally deleted items** (should NOT be restored)
- **Missing items** (should be restored)

## Solution

Implemented a deletion tracking system that prevents deleted items from being restored during sync:

### 1. Deletion Tracking

- **Track deleted items** in a Set with keys like `"accounts:1754516095348"`
- **Persist to localStorage** to survive page reloads
- **Load on initialization** to maintain state across sessions

### 2. Updated Sync Logic

Modified the merge logic to check if an item was intentionally deleted:

```javascript
if (!localItem && remoteItem) {
  const deletedKey = `${dataType}:${id}`;

  if (this.deletedItems.has(deletedKey)) {
    // Skip restoration of deleted items
    console.log(`üîÑ Skipping restoration of deleted ${dataType}: ${id}`);
    await this.deleteFromFirebase(id, dataType); // Sync deletion to cloud
  } else {
    // Restore missing items (not deleted)
    mergedData.push(remoteItem);
    await this.addToLocal(remoteItem, dataType);
  }
}
```

### 3. Integration with Store

Updated the store's deletion functions to mark items as deleted:

- `deleteAccount()` - marks account as deleted
- `deleteTransaction()` - marks transaction as deleted
- `deleteTransactions()` - marks multiple transactions as deleted

## Files Modified

1. **`src/services/firebaseSync.js`**
   - Added `deletedItems` Set for tracking
   - Added `markAsDeleted()` method
   - Added `loadDeletedItems()` method
   - Added `clearDeletedItems()` method
   - Updated `mergeAndSyncData()` logic
   - Added persistence to localStorage

2. **`src/store.js`**
   - Updated `deleteAccount()` to mark as deleted
   - Updated `deleteTransaction()` to mark as deleted
   - Updated `deleteTransactions()` to mark as deleted

3. **`scripts/clear-deleted-items.js`**
   - Utility script to clear deletion tracking

## Testing

### Automated Test

Run the test script to verify the fix:

```bash
node test-deletion-fix-simple.js
```

Expected output:

```
üéâ All tests passed! Deletion tracking is working correctly
üìù The fix will prevent deleted accounts from reappearing after sync
```

### Manual Testing

1. **Clear existing deletion tracking:**

   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   localStorage.removeItem("deletedItems");
   ```

2. **Delete an account in the app**

3. **Refresh the page** - account should stay deleted

4. **Verify in console** that you see:
   ```
   üîÑ Skipping restoration of deleted accounts: [account-id]
   ```

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Deleted accounts stay deleted** after page refresh  
‚úÖ **Deleted transactions stay deleted** after page refresh  
‚úÖ **Cross-device sync respects deletions**  
‚úÖ **Non-deleted items still sync properly**  
‚úÖ **Persistence across browser sessions**  
‚úÖ **Automatic cleanup of old deletion records**

## Technical Details

### Deletion Key Format

- Accounts: `"accounts:1754516095348"`
- Transactions: `"transactions:123456789"`

### Storage

- **Memory**: `Set` for fast lookups during sync
- **Persistence**: `localStorage` for survival across page reloads
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of old deletion records

### Error Handling

- Graceful fallback if localStorage is unavailable
- Continues sync even if deletion tracking fails
- Logs warnings but doesn't break functionality

## Future Improvements

1. **Add timestamps** to deletion records for better cleanup
2. **Server-side deletion tracking** for better cross-device sync
3. **Bulk deletion operations** for better performance
4. **Deletion confirmation** to prevent accidental deletions

## Troubleshooting

### If accounts still reappear:

1. **Check deletion tracking:**

   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("deletedItems") || "[]"));
   ```

2. **Clear and retest:**

   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem("deletedItems");
   // Delete account again
   ```

3. **Check sync logs** for restoration messages

### If sync stops working:

1. **Clear deletion tracking:**

   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem("deletedItems");
   ```

2. **Restart the app**

3. **Check Firebase connectivity**

## Migration Notes

- **Existing users**: No migration needed, deletion tracking starts fresh
- **New deletions**: Will be properly tracked going forward
- **Old deletions**: May reappear once, then stay deleted after next deletion
