üîß ACTUAL OAUTH FIX - WHAT YOU CAN CHANGE
=========================================

üìã CURRENT DEPLOYMENT URL:
   https://aura-finance-8w7dmobl5-bhabishya-shresthas-projects.vercel.app

üö® IMPORTANT: YOU CANNOT CHANGE SUPABASE AUTH CONFIGURATION
   That's managed by Supabase and you don't have access to modify it.

üîß WHAT YOU CAN AND SHOULD CHANGE:

1. GOOGLE OAUTH CONFIGURATION:
   Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
   Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID for this project
   
   ‚úÖ UPDATE AUTHORIZED JAVASCRIPT ORIGINS:
   - https://aura-finance-8w7dmobl5-bhabishya-shresthas-projects.vercel.app
   - http://localhost:5173
   
   ‚úÖ KEEP AUTHORIZED REDIRECT URIS AS:
   - https://mdpfwvqpwkiojnzpctou.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback (DO NOT CHANGE)

2. GITHUB OAUTH CONFIGURATION:
   Go to: https://github.com/settings/developers
   Find your OAuth App for this project
   
   ‚úÖ UPDATE HOMEPAGE URL:
   https://aura-finance-8w7dmobl5-bhabishya-shresthas-projects.vercel.app
   
   ‚úÖ KEEP AUTHORIZATION CALLBACK URL AS:
   - https://mdpfwvqpwkiojnzpctou.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback (DO NOT CHANGE)

üîÑ ADDITIONAL TROUBLESHOOTING:

3. CLEAR BROWSER CACHE:
   - Clear all browser data on your phone
   - Try incognito/private browsing mode
   - Clear cookies and site data for vercel.app

4. CHECK YOUR .ENV FILE:
   - Make sure VITE_SUPABASE_URL is correct
   - Make sure VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY is correct

5. VERIFY YOU'RE TESTING THE RIGHT URL:
   - Use: https://aura-finance-8w7dmobl5-bhabishya-shresthas-projects.vercel.app/auth
   - Not any old deployment URLs

üéØ TESTING STEPS:
1. Update Google and GitHub configurations above
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate
3. Clear browser cache on your phone
4. Test at: https://aura-finance-8w7dmobl5-bhabishya-shresthas-projects.vercel.app/auth
5. Try both Google and GitHub OAuth

‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL REMINDER:
- Supabase Auth configuration is FIXED and cannot be changed
- Only update Google and GitHub OAuth settings
- The redirect to Vercel might be due to browser caching or old URLs

üöÄ IF STILL NOT WORKING:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all URLs are exactly as shown above
- Consider setting up a custom domain for stability
- The issue might be that Vercel's dynamic URLs are causing problems
