üîß OAUTH FLOW TEST FOR AURA FINANCE
====================================

‚úÖ CURRENT STATUS:
Your OAuth callback is now properly configured to handle hash-based tokens.

üéØ WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NOW:

1. When you click "Login with Google" on your phone:
   - You'll be redirected to Google OAuth
   - After successful authentication, you'll be redirected to:
     https://aura-finance-tool.vercel.app/auth/callback#access_token=...
   - The AuthCallbackPage will extract the tokens from the URL hash
   - It will establish a session and redirect you to the dashboard

2. The callback page will show:
   - "Processing Authentication..." (loading)
   - "Authentication successful! Redirecting..." (success)
   - Then redirect to /dashboard

üîç TROUBLESHOOTING:

If you still get a 404 error:
1. Make sure you're accessing: https://aura-finance-tool.vercel.app
2. Check that the /auth/callback route is properly deployed
3. Try clearing your browser cache and cookies

If authentication fails:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your Supabase configuration is correct
3. Make sure your OAuth providers are configured with the right callback URLs

üìã NEXT STEPS:

1. Test the OAuth flow on your phone
2. Check the browser console for any error messages
3. If it works, you should be redirected to the dashboard
4. If it doesn't work, check the console logs for debugging info

üöÄ READY TO TEST!
Your OAuth callback should now work correctly with the hash-based tokens.
