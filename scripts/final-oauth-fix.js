üö® FINAL OAUTH FIX - STOPPING VERCELL REDIRECTS
==============================================

üìã CURRENT DEPLOYMENT URL:
   https://aura-finance-8w7dmobl5-bhabishya-shresthas-projects.vercel.app

üîç DIAGNOSIS:
   You're being redirected to Vercel because your OAuth providers are still configured with old URLs.
   The code is now correct, but external configurations need updating.

üîß IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED:

1. SUPABASE AUTH CONFIGURATION (MOST IMPORTANT):
   Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/mdpfwvqpwkiojnzpctou/auth/url-configuration
   
   ‚úÖ UPDATE SITE URL:
   https://aura-finance-8w7dmobl5-bhabishya-shresthas-projects.vercel.app
   
   ‚úÖ UPDATE ADDITIONAL REDIRECT URLS:
   - https://aura-finance-8w7dmobl5-bhabishya-shresthas-projects.vercel.app
   - http://localhost:5173
   
   ‚ùå DO NOT CHANGE:
   - Supabase callback URL (leave as is)

2. GOOGLE OAUTH CONFIGURATION:
   Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
   Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID for this project
   
   ‚úÖ UPDATE AUTHORIZED JAVASCRIPT ORIGINS:
   - https://aura-finance-8w7dmobl5-bhabishya-shresthas-projects.vercel.app
   - http://localhost:5173
   
   ‚úÖ KEEP AUTHORIZED REDIRECT URIS:
   - https://mdpfwvqpwkiojnzpctou.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback (DO NOT CHANGE)

3. GITHUB OAUTH CONFIGURATION:
   Go to: https://github.com/settings/developers
   Find your OAuth App for this project
   
   ‚úÖ UPDATE HOMEPAGE URL:
   https://aura-finance-8w7dmobl5-bhabishya-shresthas-projects.vercel.app
   
   ‚úÖ KEEP AUTHORIZATION CALLBACK URL:
   - https://mdpfwvqpwkiojnzpctou.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback (DO NOT CHANGE)

üîÑ ADDITIONAL TROUBLESHOOTING:

4. CLEAR BROWSER CACHE:
   - Clear all browser data on your phone
   - Try incognito/private browsing mode
   - Clear cookies and site data for vercel.app

5. CHECK FOR OLD DEPLOYMENTS:
   - Make sure you're testing the correct URL
   - Old deployments might still be cached

6. VERIFY ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
   - Check that your .env file has correct Supabase URLs
   - Ensure VITE_SUPABASE_URL is correct

üéØ TESTING STEPS:
1. Update all configurations above
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate
3. Test at: https://aura-finance-8w7dmobl5-bhabishya-shresthas-projects.vercel.app/auth
4. Try both Google and GitHub OAuth
5. Test on both desktop and mobile

‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL REMINDER:
- Supabase callback URL is FIXED and should NEVER be changed
- Only update the site URLs and JavaScript origins
- The redirect to Vercel happens when OAuth providers don't recognize your current URL

üöÄ IF STILL NOT WORKING:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all URLs are exactly as shown above
- Consider setting up a custom domain for stability
